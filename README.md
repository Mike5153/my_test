# My Test Project

This project contains a collection of Java examples that demonstrate various programming concepts and potential issues.

## Components

### 1. Interest Calculator

The `InterestCalculator` class calculates interest on a series of transactions. It supports both compound and simple interest calculations.

**Key Features:**

*   Calculates interest based on a daily rate.
*   Handles both income and outcome transactions.
*   Can calculate interest with or without compounding.

### 2. JavaVMStackSOF

The `JavaVMStackSOF` class is a simple example that demonstrates how to trigger a `StackOverflowError` by using a recursive function with no exit condition.

### 3. Test

The `Test` class contains two examples:

*   A method that demonstrates how to trigger an `OutOfMemoryError` by continuously adding objects to a list.
*   A method that measures the time it takes to create a large number of objects.

## How to Run

Each of the main classes (`InterestCalculator`, `JavaVMStackSOF`, `Test`) can be run directly from your IDE or from the command line.
